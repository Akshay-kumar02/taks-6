1. Create Passwords

Generated multiple passwords with different:

Lengths (short, medium, long)

Character sets (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)

Patterns (random, dictionary-based, mixed)

2. Test Password Strength

Each password was tested using an online password strength checker (e.g., Kaspersky Password Checker
, Have I Been Pwned
, or other tools).

3. Record Results

Collected feedback and scores provided by the strength checker, noting:

Estimated time to crack

Strength rating (Weak / Medium / Strong)

Security suggestions

4. Analyze Best Practices

After reviewing the results, identified characteristics of strong passwords and common weaknesses in poor ones.

5. Research Password Attacks

Researched common attack types:

Brute Force Attack — systematically tries all possible combinations

Dictionary Attack — uses common words or leaked passwords

📊 Findings
✅ Best Practices for Strong Passwords

Use at least 12–16 characters.

Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.

Avoid common words, phrases, or personal info.

Prefer passphrases (e.g., Red$Moon!Drifts42) over single words.

Don’t reuse passwords across multiple sites.

Consider using a password manager for secure storage.

🧠 Key Insights
Factor	Impact on Strength
Length	Exponentially increases cracking time
Character Variety	Prevents predictable patterns
Randomness	Makes dictionary attacks ineffective
Avoiding Personal Info	Reduces targeted guessing risks
Unique Passwords	Limits damage if one account is compromised
🔍 Summary

Password complexity directly affects security.

Short or simple passwords are easily broken by brute-force or dictionary attacks.

Long, random, and diverse passwords drastically increase the time and effort required to crack them.
Ultimately, password security is a balance of complexity, uniqueness, and manageability.
